Videos are limited to a resolution of 1280x720 by default. I simply `nop`'d the comparisions and jumps immediately before `20001F0:"Video is using a resolution that is not supported."`.

Also, you could only play two videos at a time. I want ahead and fixed that.

In Rōblox version 463, you can apply the `v463-*.1337` files as patches in x32dbg.

PS: the only videos which were supported in 2021E were `.webm` containers. Use FFmpeg or something if you couldn't bring one with you.
